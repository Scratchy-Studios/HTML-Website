        <h2>About Us, Like, Duh</h2>
        <p>We're a bunch of code-lovin' goofballs who live and breathe Scratch. We get hyped about making games that are both fun AND teach your little Einsteins how to code. Basically, we're like the Avengers of Scratch... except way less spandex and way more pizza.</p>
